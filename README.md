# Instructions
If you have docker, to run the MongoDB instance and the backend API, run on the root folder:
    - docker-compose up -d --build
If you do not have docker, you need to install the mongodb serve and, on the root folder:
    - npm run dev
The frontend is vanilla JS + HTML so you just need to go to frontend folder and double click on the INDEX.HTML file.

# NOTE:
As explained during the interview with Margarida, my FRONTEND experience is basically NULL so the frontend part reflects it.
